# 4.1 Multiple Features
So far we already have some basic understanding about linear regression. Now is time to add more features, we still use the housing price problem as our example:

Size <br/> (feet<sup>2</sup>)  | Number of bedrooms|Number of floors| Age of home| Price
------------- | -----------------------------------|----------------|--------------|-------------|
2104 | 5|1|45|460
1416|3|2|40|232
1534|3|2|30|315
852|2|1|36|178
